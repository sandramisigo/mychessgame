# Chess Game using Pygame

This is a simple Chess game that is created using the **Python Pygame Library**. This chess game enables you to play a game of chess against another player. It helps one understand how to build board games using Python with Pygame. 

## Game Features
- Has a full chess game implementation (with no AI usage, only two-player mode acted).
- All chess rules implemented.
- Adopts a Graphical user interface that uses Pygame for drawing the chessboard and the chess pieces.

## Getting Started on the Game

### Prerequisites
- Install Python 3.x on your computer.
- Install Pygame library.

```bash
pip install pygame

Running the Game
1. To run the chess game, use the following command:
2. python3 main.py. This will launch the game window, and you can start playing chess!

**How to Play Chess**
1. Have two players, Player 1 (White) and Player 2 (Black) taking turns to move the pieces.
2. Clicking on a piece selects it, whereas clicking on a valid square moves the piece there.
3. The game ensures all legal chess moves.

**Modifications**
 1. Feel free to modify the chess game by adding new features, improving the graphics, or even implementing an AI opponent.

**Future Improvements**
1. Adding a single-player mode with AI.
2. Improving piece designs and graphics.
3. Implementing time controls to ensure a more competitive experience.

**Built With**
1. Pygame - The Python library for game development.
